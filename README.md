<strong>A Project that was actually used to help non-profit agencies with website building services.</strong><br>
This <strong>website was really used as a pitch to non-profit agencies to offer free website building services.</strong>
The menu list drops down and where appropriate (eg social media links that actually links you to those sites)<br>
demonstrates functionality (eg calendar, forms, menus, & hyperlinks) .<br>  The baseline website <strong>demonstrates responsive web design such that it reacts to window resizing to accomodate different device screen sizes.</strong>
